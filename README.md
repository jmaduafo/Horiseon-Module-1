# Horiseon Module 1 Challenge

## Description

This project was used to teach about semantic tags, the hierarchy of heading texts (h1 - h6), and the functionality of ids and classes. With this assignment, I learned to be more observant. When viewing the website, it looked pretty functional, but in the HTML and CSS, there were some imperfections with accuracy and organization. It's important to have clean code that keeps accessibility in mind.

## Usage

Look at **feature/html-css branch**
This is a standard home page with header, sections, and footer. Click the nav links to navigate throughout the page.
